# Risk policy

This document is the source-of-truth for every position cap, loss threshold,
and kill-switch trigger in the engine. Any change to it **requires** a
corresponding change to the code in `crates/strategy-*`, `crates/engine`,
or `crates/clob-dispatcher` — and vice versa. The `risk-reviewer` subagent
under `.claude/agents/` will block merges that update one without the other.

## Absolute caps — $50k-book RESEARCH tier (operator ruling 2026-08-29)

Strategies assume a **$50,000 book** in M5 paper research; the DD line
is the operator's 15%-of-book ruling. Enforced in: the §4.2 ruleset
validator rule 7 (`ingress-ai::ruleset`), the VM emit-time clamp
(`strategy-vm::POLICY_SINGLE_ORDER_CAP_1E6`), the backtest/audit-pnl
fill law (`cli::backtest::fill` — open-order caps + caps-rejections),
and the worker gate thresholds (`claude_worker.backtest.GateThresholds`,
frozen-surface amendment with this ruling cited in the pin tests).

| cap                          | value     | enforced in                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| max open orders per symbol   | 8         | `cli::backtest::fill` (paper model)  |
| max total open orders        | 64        | `cli::backtest::fill` (paper model)  |
| max net notional per symbol  | $20 000   | rule 7 + gates (RiskGate at 8i)      |
| max net notional total       | $100 000  | rule 7 + gates (2× book gross)       |
| max single-order notional    | $10 000   | rule 7 + VM clamp + gates            |
| max OOS drawdown (gate)      | $7 500    | `GateThresholds` (15% of book)       |

Paper mode treats every fill as real for P&L accounting so the caps are
exercised on the same code path that live mode will use. Statistical
gates (OOS > 0, ≥ 50 trades, ≥ 1 trading day) are scale-independent.
**The trading-day floor moved 2 → 1** under the MVP-tempo operator
ruling of 2026-08-30 (`GateThresholds.min_trading_days`, D1-pattern
frozen-surface amendment, cited in the pin tests) so a ~12 h capture age
suffices for staging; the accepted trade-off is that an OOS verdict can
come from a single day's regime — the old floor was the
single-regime-overfit guard. **Superseded 2026-09-05 by the ≤ 2 h
law + the regime lane:** evidence is now a COUNT of disjoint complete
≤ 2 h windows pooled and judged leave-one-window-out (never days —
`docs/regime-and-dashboard-plan.md` §7.1), and the single-regime
overfit is guarded by the regime GATE itself: a labelled row trades
only in the words it was evidenced in, UNKNOWN fails it closed, and
its label must earn the `--regime off` delta.

## Regime gate (RG0–RG7, 2026-09-03 →) — a gate, never a signal

`docs/regime-and-dashboard-plan.md` §2 is the doctrine; the risk-relevant
laws, enforced in `crates/core-regime` (the detector), `crates/strategy-set`
(per-member gates), `crates/strategy-vm` (per-row gate bytes) and
`ingress-ai::ruleset` (validator rule 11 + the rule-8 amendment):

- **Entries only.** A closed gate blocks ENTRIES; it never blocks an
  exit and never flips a table. `off = soft` lets the position drain by
  its own exit law; `off = hard` flattens on the flip
  (`engine_vm_regime_hard_exits_total`, `engine_icdp_regime_exits_total`).
- **Fail closed.** UNKNOWN words (warm-up, a declaration that expired,
  a venue-dark FUND dimension) close every LABELLED row/member; an
  unlabelled row is bit-identical to pre-RG0 behaviour.
- **Declarations are bounded.** A `SetRegime` frame carries a TTL
  (`ttl_ns = 0` refused at the shape check); after it expires the
  engine's own measurement rules. Declarations never bypass caps.
- **No flicker.** Hysteresis bands + `confirm_min = 3`; the RG7 soak
  bounds flips to ≤ 2 per profile × dimension per ≤ 2 h window from the
  engine's own counters (`python -m claude_worker.regime soak`).
- **Read-only observability.** `/state` (9191), the TUI and the
  dashboard page (9292) carry no control into the AI plane —
  enable/disable/declare/halt stay verbs and frames under the
  single-writer seq law.

**Superseded demo tier (Phase 0 → 2026-08-29):** 4/sym · 32 total ·
$250/sym · $1 000 total · $100/order · $200 DD — the numbers every
pre-M5 backtest report and audit was measured against; historical
reports keep meaning under the tier that produced them. Any LIVE
(Stage-3) tier is a separate future ruling — these are research caps.

## Kill-switch triggers

The engine unconditionally flips to **halt** (no new orders, cancel all
open, stop ingesting rules) on any of the following:

1. Realized-loss cap breached in a rolling 24 h window.
2. Unrealized-loss cap breached per symbol.
3. A fill arrives for a `client_oid` the engine does not have on record.
4. Two consecutive WS reconnect failures to the Polymarket CLOB within 60 s.
5. `core-alloc::CountingAllocator` reports any allocation in a tick-loop
   iteration. (debug builds only; release aborts via `panic = "abort"`.)
6. A `debug_assert!` fails in a strategy's `on_tick`/`on_signal`/`on_fill`.

Halt is **sticky**: it requires a manual engine restart. No "auto-resume"
logic is permitted — a halted engine means a human investigates.

## Signing-key handling

- The EIP-712 signing key is loaded from the project-root `.env` file only.
- Boot-time: the key is `mlock`'d into its own page (see
  `crates/core-config::SecretKeyBytes`).
- Drop: the key page is zeroized and `munlock`'d.
- Debug: the `Secrets` struct has a custom `Debug` impl that redacts the
  key. Any code that formats or logs the key without redaction fails the
  `risk-reviewer` subagent check.

## Phased loosening

The caps above are **Phase 0** (paper, local). They are deliberately tight
— we run thousands of ticks through the engine at these levels before
widening anything. Each subsequent phase (see `PLAN.md`) requires:

1. A P&L report from the prior phase showing the caps were not the bottleneck.
2. A written risk note in `docs/risk-policy.md` (this file) describing the
   new caps and the empirical basis for them.
3. Sign-off from the operator (the human, not the engine).

No exceptions. A cap change without the above is a kill-switch-trigger bug
waiting to happen.
